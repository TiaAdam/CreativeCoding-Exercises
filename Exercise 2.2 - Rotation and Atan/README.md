Excersise 2.2 - Rotation and Atan

 - In this Exercise, we learned how to use rotation (rotate()) function provided to us by P5 and Atan2 function.

 - Rotation function, rotate(), rotates a shape by the amount that is specified by angle parameter. Angle mode is important for this function to work and we can use it in either RADIANS or DEGREES.

 - Atan2 function, calculates the angle in radians from a specified point to the coordinate origin as measured from the positive point on x-axis.

 - In this exercise, we also used dist() function which calculates the distance between two points, as well as map() function which re-maps number from one range to another.

 - For this exercise, we worked with variables numOfSquares and squareSize - size of squares is determined by dividing the width of the Canvas, 500, with numOfSquares we want to display on it.

 - A for loop was created which first looped throuhgh y-axis values (j) and then throuhg x-axis values (i) in order to draw shape across the Canvas.
