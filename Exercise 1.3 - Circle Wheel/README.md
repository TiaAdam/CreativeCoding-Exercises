Excersise 1.3 - Circle Wheel

    - Exercise 1.3 required from us to create and display a Color Wheel.

    - Exercise required from us to be familiar with Math of circle and importance of SOH,CAH,TOA - In this specific case Sin(y) and Cos(x).

    - Sin and Cos helped us to position the circle on the canvas by adding the constant variable of radius to it. Example: let vx= (radius * cos(a)) +250;
                    let vy= (radius *sin(a)) +250;

    - Exercise also includes code for Translation and Mapping, which is greatly used in Exercise 1.4.
