Excersise 1.5 - Lerp Color
- In this Exercise, we learned how to use Lerp Color function provided by p5.

- Lerp Color function, lerpColor(), blends two colors to find a third color somewhere in between them. It takes three parameters: color1, color2 and amt.

- Amt parameter is the amount between the two values where 0.0 is equal to color1, 0.1 close to color1, 0.5 is in the middle, etc.

- Again for this exercise, we created Circle Wheel (Triangle fan), which we then later filled with colors we lerped using Lerp Color
