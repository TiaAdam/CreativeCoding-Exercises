Excersise Challenge V2 - Our Pattern

- - For the purpose of this Exercise Challenge, and a few following Exercises, we have been asked to create a pattern of our choice.

- Pattern that was an inspiration to this Exercise is carpet Pattern from the film Shining by Stanley Kubrick.

- Pattern is consisted of number of different colored hexagons layed on top of one another.

- V2 code is the continuing code for Excersise Challenge - Our Pattern.

- In V2, another hexagon was created to be displayed at the top of first one.

- Both hexagons were put into separate functions outside of function draw() which are called createHex() and createHex2(). Functions are called in draw function and correctly displayed.

- The outcome of this V2 is the display of 6 hexagons across x-axis and y-axis, which under the change of angleMode from DEGREES to RADIANS turned into a star-like shape. 

- Images of the outcome and inspiration can be seen in the Images folder of this Exercise.
