Exercise 1.1 - Loops and Color

- Required from us to create a canvas(500,500) and display grid which will show us the change of colors on the canvas.

- HSB color model is used to display colors in this exercise.

- Addition to Exercise 1.1 is code from Exercise 1.2 which allows us to move
canvas/grid around and to see the change of colors. Code also allows us to 'take screenshot' of the screen or save image everytime when we press ctrl+S.
