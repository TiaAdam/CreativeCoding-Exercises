Excersise Challenge - Our Pattern

- For the purpose of this Exercise Challenge, and a few following Exercises, we have been asked to create a pattern of our choice.

- Pattern that was an inspiration to this Exercise is carpet Pattern from the film Shining by Stanley Kubrick.

- Pattern is consisted of number of different colored hexagons layed on top of one another.

- For creating a starting look of the pattern, four variables were created - numOfHex, hexSize, stepAngle and radius. Angle mode for this Exercise is set to DEGREES.

- In function draw(), nested for loop was created, to make sure hexagons are displaying across the canvas (6 of them, numOfHex determines hexagons and their shape).

- Inside function draw there is another for loop - put in between push() and pop() for creating hexagonal shape.

- The outcome of this starting code Exercise is the display of 6 hexagons across x-axis and y-axis, colored in orange with lerpColor().

- Images of the outcome and inspiration can be seen in the Images folder of this Exercise.
