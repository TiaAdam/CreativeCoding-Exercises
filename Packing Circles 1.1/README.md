Packing Circles Exercise - Term 2

- In this exercise, we learned how to combine classes, arrays and methods in order to display numerous circles that are packing to each other and with that they all filling up all the empty and blank spaces in between already created circles.

- For the purpose of this exercise, an array has been crated which has an intention to store the position of every circle created and displayed on the Canvas.

- Inside of the function draw (), there is a for loop which creates circles and pushes them into the array.

- There is also a generateCircles function, which is then continuously adding circles to the array and displaying them. Purpose of this function is also to see if circles are anywhere near each other (to detect their edge), to see if circle is already created in certain position and then display the circle.
