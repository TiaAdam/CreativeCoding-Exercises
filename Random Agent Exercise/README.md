Random Agent Exercise - Term 2

- In first exercise of Term 2, we were required to write an algorithm which will make an ellipse move in 'random' directions on canvas.

- In this case, an ellipse is only moving either left or right on canvas. That is achieved by using it-statements which say that if variable direction is either -1 or 1, movement is either in left or right direction.
