Excersise Challenge V3 - Our Pattern

- - For the purpose of this Exercise Challenge, and a few following Exercises, we have been asked to create a pattern of our choice.

- Pattern that was an inspiration to this Exercise is carpet Pattern from the film Shining by Stanley Kubrick.

- Pattern is consisted of number of different colored hexagons layed on top of one another.

- V3 code is the continuing code for Excersise Challenge - Our Pattern and V2 of that code.

- In V3, another hexagon was created to be displayed at the top of first one.

- Both hexagons were put into separate functions outside of function draw() which are called createHex() and createHex2(). Functions are called in draw function and correctly displayed.

- The outcome of this V3 is the display of 6 hexagons across x-axis and y-axis, and at the top of them, another set of smaller red hexagons is displayed.

- Images of the outcome and inspiration can be seen in the Images folder of this Exercise.
