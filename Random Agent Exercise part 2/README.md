Random Agent Exercise 1.2 - Term 2

- This Exercise folder contains code that is addition to previous Random Agent Exercise.

- In this Exercise, we were required to make object move in 'random' direction (based on optionsX and optionsY provided).

- We were also required to allow object (an ellipse, which ended up creating a line with its movements) to appear on the other side of Canvas when it 'disappears' on the other.

- We also added keyReleased function which allows us to, by pressing certain keys on keyboard, display different circles which then end up displaying different formation of lines (large, small, bold...).
