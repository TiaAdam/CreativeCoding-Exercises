Exercise 1.2 - Adding Interaction and saving Images

- Exercise 1.2 is an add-on to Exercise 1.1 in which we worked with For Loops and Color.

- Exercise enables user to move the Canvas, by pressing the left key of the mouse. It also allows user to 'take' a screenshot of the Canvas. If user presses ctrl+S, an Image (screenshot) will displayed as saved on users PC.

- Image that user saves will saved in format of date and time, telling us when user exactly pressed ctrl+S.
