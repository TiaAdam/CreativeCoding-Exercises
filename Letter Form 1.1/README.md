Letter Form - Term 2

- In this exercise, we learned how to work with letters and text.

- This exercise required from us to import libraries and fonts which will allow us to display letters on the screen.

- For certain for to work, we had to make sure that we are importing them in either .otf or .ttf form.

- In the function draw() then, we worked with beginShape() in order to generate the shape of letter and also while creating shapes, we imported fonts again.
