CA2 - Generative Agency - Tijana Adam - N00170280

- For the Final Project we have been required to create an example of Generative Agency.

- For this project, I have created a generative loop animation on the basis of Transformations, with the use of Sin and Cos.  

- Loop is consisted of lines that generate to form the circle and move in and out of the centre of the canvas with the help of low frameCount(), polygons that are being generated at the outer end of each line and are also positioned to form a circle (they also rotate with the use of frameCount), and finally an ellipse which move in and out of the canvas (users view point).

- The speed of their movement increases as they approach the centre of the canvas where they rotate and then slowly start to disappear of the canvas. Initial idea for the project was to create a shape which would be created of only lines and circles that are strictly attached to the lines and move at the same pace as them.

- User would not have been able to control the movement of the object on the screen (object would move by itself, but in the Version 2 and Version 3 of this project the size of the object is increasing and decreasing based on the mouse movement of user.

- It worked in a way that once mouse is far away from the centre of the canvas, radius of the object would be greater), but user would have been able to control the change of colour of the object and colour would change every time when user moves the mouse over the canvas.

- The end result enables the colour change of the object, but only if users is pressing the mouse key on the canvas, otherwise colour would not be changing by itself.
