Random Agent Exercise 1.3 - Circle - Term 2

- This Exercise folder contains code that is similar to previous Random Agent Exercises but this time we worked on the random movement of circle.

- In this Exercise, we were required to make object move in 'random' direction (based on optionsX and optionsY provided).

- We also had to use Sin and Cos, for moving circle randomly across the Canvas.
