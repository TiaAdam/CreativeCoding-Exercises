Excersise 1.4 - Translation

- In this exercise, we learned about translation, along with push() and pop().

- This fairly simple exercise required from us to display two rectangles which have the exact same measurements and use translate() to see how will each move slightly on the Canvas.

- Translate() specifies an amount to displace objects within the display window. It takes two parameters, x - for moving from left to right, and y - for moving up and  down.
